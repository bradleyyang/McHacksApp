## Inspiration
The inspiration for an app like Memo stems from a desire to address common challenges people face in budgeting and expense tracking. The idea originates from observing the inconvenience of manual data entry or the difficulty in keeping an accurate record of daily expenses. Additionally, the increasing reliance on digital receipts and the need for a more intuitive and efficient solution to manage finances are key motivators. 
## What it does
Memo takes snapshots of receipts using the webcam, processing the data and returning insightful feedback on spending habits. Details include time and location of purchases, price of purchases, and name of stores. Memo then displays the information in a visually appealing user interface for users to easily analyze their spending. 
## How we built it
We built it with Flask, Python, SQL, Tailwind, CSS, React, tesseract, and opencv.
## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulty setting up the database to store the information from the snapshots of receipts. We also had to use OpenCV on our webcam snapshots to increase the accuracy of the text recognition.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though we had little experience with backend development, we created a functioning app that integrated databases and backend technologies such as flask.
## What we learned
We learned Flask, Python, SQL, Tailwind, CSS, React, tesseract, opencv, and we learned to COLLABORATE.
## What's next for Memo
We plan on improving the data visualization for Memo by leveraging Google Maps API. For a better and more intuitive user experience, Memo will display the users' purchases through a 3D map of the store locations, providing insightful data on the time and dates of each purchase.
